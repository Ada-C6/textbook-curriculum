# Layout: Display


## Learning Goals ðŸ“š
- Can identify element's default display values
- Can change an element's display value appropriately

## Display Property
The display property has a long list of potential values. There are three values we are going to focus on while we learn about layout: inline, inline-block & block.

- Inline elements:
  - respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
  - cannot have a width and height set
  - allow other elements to sit to their left and right.

- Block elements:
  - respect all of those
  - force a line break after the block element

- Inline-block elements:
  - allow other elements to sit to their left and right
  - respect top & bottom margins and padding
  - respect height and width

## Modifying an element's default styles

To have elements with default block displays to be inline with each other, it's display property and width need to be modified.
